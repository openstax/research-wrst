plotnine is an implementation of a *grammar of graphics* in Python,
it is based on ggplot2. The grammar allows users to compose plots
by explicitly mapping data to the visual objects that make up the
plot.

Plotting with a grammar is powerful, it makes custom (and otherwise
complex) plots are easy to think about and then create, while the
simple plots remain simple.

To find out about all building blocks that you can use to create a
plot, check out the documentation_. Since plotnine has an API
similar to ggplot2, where we lack in coverage the
`ggplot2 documentation`_ may be of some help.
