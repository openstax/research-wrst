You may be eligible to take part in a research study. This form gives you important information about
the study. It describes the purpose of the research, the risks and possible benefits of participating in
the study.

Purpose of this Study

The overarching goal of this research is to develop a novel method for generating knowledge graphs
(KGs). Briefly, KGs are a structured representation of knowledge in a particular domain (e.g., Physics,
Biology, etc.). KGs have many applications in educational technology, such as automatic question
generation and automated summarization. However, they are time consuming and expensive to
generate. The purpose of the study is to evaluate a new learning task designed to make generation of
these knowledge graphs easier and less expensive.

In this study, you will read an educational science text, then be asked to label the relationship
between concepts that you read about in the task. The study will take approximately 30 minutes to
complete.
